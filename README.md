# Bugchecker

Bugchecker is my first C# program that I will add on to for practice/learning purposes. 

In its current state, it's a simple program that prompts the user to enter a bug check code (0x1A for example) and will shoot back the documented description. My goal as time goes on is to eventually get into elaborate and more technical descriptions, as well as go into detailed debugging solutions. This may not be feasable with the command line, so maybe a GUI in the unforseeable future.
