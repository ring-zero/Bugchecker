# Bugchecker

Bugchecker is my first C# program that I will add on to for practice/learning purposes. 

# What does it do?

In its current state, it's a simple program that prompts the user to enter a bug check code (0xD1 for example) and will shoot back the documented description, as well as detailed debugging tips, notes, etc. Likely a GUI in the future as it'd just make everything easier for both parties.

# Notes

This program is constantly undergoing drastic change as I'm frequently discovering more efficient ways to do things.
