# Bugchecker

Bugchecker is my first C# program that I will add on to based on any new knowledge I obtain. 

At its core, it's a simple program that prompts the user to enter a bug check code (0x1A for example) and will shoot back
the documented description. My goal as time goes on is to eventually get into elaborate and more technical descriptions,
as well as go into detailed debugging solutions. This may not be feasable with the command line, so maybe a GUI in the
unforseeable future.
